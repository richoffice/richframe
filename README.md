# RichFrame

[gota](https://github.com/go-gota/gota) provide a DataFrame impletation framework for Golang.
I just need some methods to handle `[]map<string>interface{}`, so I create RichFrame that can
do some work like DataFrame.

You can view the `*_test.go` to get the usage. It's easy and directly.
